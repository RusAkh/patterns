# Proxy

Type: `Structural`

## Overview

The Proxy design pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object. It allows for controlling access to the underlying object by introducing an intermediary proxy object. The proxy acts as a representative for the real object and can add additional functionality or control object creation and destruction. It maintains the same interface as the real object, providing a seamless experience for clients. The Proxy pattern adds an extra layer of indirection, enabling flexible and controlled access to objects.
