# Builder Design Pattern

## Overview

The Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern that helps separate the construction process of complex objects from their representation. This pattern is particularly useful when the construction process involves multiple steps, some of which might be optional or require different configurations. By using the Builder pattern, you can create objects step by step, reusing the same construction code to create different representations of the object.

## Main Components

* Product: The complex object being constructed.
* Builder: An abstract interface that defines the methods for constructing the various parts of the Product. It provides a contract for building the object step by step.
* Concrete Builder: A class that implements the Builder interface, providing the actual implementation for constructing the Product. There can be multiple Concrete Builders, each responsible for creating a different representation of the Product.
* Director: A class that is responsible for constructing the Product using a Builder instance. The Director takes a Builder as an argument, and then calls the appropriate Builder methods to construct the Product.
